# Production Line Tracker
This project is a program that enables users to add new products to the database,
record when the products are produced, as well as how many products were produced.
This project was made by me, Bernard Georges, throughout the Fall Semester of 2019
circa August to December. At this point, I would consider myself intermediate in all aspects
covered in this project. This initially started out as being made for an assignment, 
but eventually turned into something a bit more fun as I tried to make sure it was as
concise as possible. It was made  predominantly at home, but I also worked on it in the classroom,
at local coffee stations, the engineering lounge at school, and really anywhere else that I had free time.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the the program. Unzip the download.
2. Open/import the project through your preferred IDE (Intellij, Eclipse, etc)
3. Run the program through the Main class and test out it's functionality.

## Built With
* IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate - Enables the use of creating Java applications, either console based or GUI.
* The ultimate version also has built in Database tools without having to install any plug ins. Enabled the author
to create multiple class files, directories, xml files, etc.
* Gluon Scene Builder - Used in place of Swing. Used for GUI development, enabling a visual basic-esque
style of programming, permitting the use of drag and drop (either straight to the scene
or to the schema on the right)

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
* Object Oriented programming (i.e. utilizing Classes Product and ProductionRecord to create Objects with specific fields
that are then put to use by other Classes).
* Functional Programming (i.e. Multiple methods within classes not necessarily intended to be classes from which
objects are created. These methods do things such as reverse a string, getting different item types, etc.).
* Recursion (used to reverse a string).
